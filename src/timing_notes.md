CAMERA_TICK_FREQUENCY = 399996034  # Hz (400 MHz)

Fascinating discovery! Your camera is using a **400 MHz tick frequency** (precisely 399,996,034 Hz). This explains everything:

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Picture Now Clear:

1. **Camera tick frequency: 400 MHz** (0.4 GHz)
   - Not a standard frequency like 100 MHz or 1 GHz
   - Likely chosen for specific hardware reasons

2. **Perfect synchronization confirmed**:
   - Average frame interval matches exactly: 16.67 ms (both hardware and system)
   - **Zero clock drift** between camera and system clocks!
   - This is excellent - your clocks are perfectly synchronized

3. **The 2.5x mystery solved**:
   - 400 MHz is 0.4x of 1 GHz
   - If something assumed 1 GHz, it would see time pass 2.5x slower (1/0.4 = 2.5)

## Key Insights:

âœ… **Your camera and system are perfectly synchronized** - 0.00 ms drift over 264 seconds is remarkable!

âœ… **Frame timing is spot-on** - 16.67 ms intervals = exactly 60 FPS

âœ… **Both timestamp sources are valid**:
   - `timestamp`: Hardware ticks at 400 MHz (need conversion)
   - `timestamp_sys`: Unix epoch nanoseconds (ready to use)

## Updated Understanding:

Your complete timing architecture:
```
Camera Hardware (60 FPS) 
    â†“ [400 MHz ticks]
Camera Driver 
    â†“ [+ system timestamp]
Your Application
    â”œâ”€â†’ Bounding Box Processing (60 FPS)
    â””â”€â†’ Stimulus Rendering (120 FPS)
```

## For Your Records:

Save these conversion constants:
```python
CAMERA_TICK_FREQUENCY = 399996034  # Hz (400 MHz)
CAMERA_FPS = 60.0
STIMULUS_FPS = 120.0

# To convert camera ticks to milliseconds:
camera_ms = (camera_ticks - first_tick) / 399996.034
```

## Why This Matters:

1. **Perfect sync means no correction needed** - You can trust either timestamp
2. **400 MHz gives 2.5ns resolution** - More than sufficient for 60 FPS video
3. **Zero drift** suggests PTP might already be enabled or your system has excellent clock discipline

Your system is performing exceptionally well! The only remaining item is checking why the latency CSV is empty - that's likely just a matter of ensuring `LogLatencyData()` is being called in your processing loop.

You're right, PTP's primary and most critical use is for synchronizing multiple cameras to ensure their frames are captured at the exact same moment. However, using PTP even with a single camera can be beneficial, depending on your accuracy requirements.

### **PTP for a Single Camera: Aligning Hardware with Reality**

Think of it this way: without PTP, your camera's clock and your computer's clock are like two separate, high-quality watches that were started at slightly different times and tick at very slightly different rates.

* **Without PTP**: The camera's `timestamp` is highly precise (it has a very fast, consistent tick), but it's relative only to when the camera powered on. It doesn't know what the "real" time is. Your `timestamp_sys` *does* know the real time, but it's recorded slightly *after* the frame is captured and transferred to the PC. For most applications, this tiny delay (~a few milliseconds) doesn't matter.

* **With PTP**: PTP synchronizes the camera's "watch" to the computer's "watch." This means the camera's internal, high-precision hardware clock is aligned with the system's real-world clock.

### **So, should you use it?**

* **You should use PTP if:** You need to correlate the exact moment of image capture with other high-precision system events. For example, if you're triggering an external device and need to know, with nanosecond accuracy, which frame corresponds to that trigger, PTP provides the most accurate link between the physical event and the image data. The timestamp is embedded in the frame data at the moment of capture, eliminating the latency of data transfer to the host computer.

* **You can skip PTP if:** You only need to know the relative time between frames, or if the small and generally consistent latency between image capture and the `timestamp_sys` measurement is acceptable for your needs. For many machine vision and recording tasks, simply using the system-generated `timestamp_sys` is perfectly adequate and simpler to manage.

**In short:** While not strictly necessary for a single camera to function, PTP offers a more robust and accurate method of timestamping by synchronizing the camera's hardware clock directly to your system's real-time clock. Given that your codebase already includes the functions to implement it (like `ptp_camera_sync`), it's a powerful feature to leverage if your application demands the highest level of temporal accuracy.
